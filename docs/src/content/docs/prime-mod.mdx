# Modifiers
Since only basic gates are supported, additional gates can be added via hooks into the `toPrime` function.

## Qiskit
```python
qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
for i in range(2):
  qc.h(i)
  qc.ry(0.3, i)
su.cx(0, 1)
su.sx(1)

pi = 3.14159
hooks = {
  'sx': [
    lambda qc, gate: qc.p(-pi / 4, gate[1][0]),
    lambda qc, gate: qc.rx(pi / 2, gate[1][0]),
  ]
}

string = toPrime(qc, hooks=hooks)
```

Hooks accepts a dictionary with the gate name as the key. The value can be a single function or a list of functions to be applied to the circuit. In the example above the $\sqrt x$ gate is substituted by a $R_x$ and a $P$ gate.

Each function receives the quantum circuit and the gate as arguments. The gate is a tuple with the gate name and the qubits it acts on.

```python
hooks = {
  # single function map
  'id': lambda qc, gate: qc.rx(0, gate[1][0]),
  # multiple function map
  'sx':[
    lambda qc, gate: qc.p(-pi / 4, gate[1][0]),
    # feel free to hard code the param/qubits
    lambda qc, gate: qc.rx(3.14 / 2, 3),
  ]
}
```

```python
def circuit(params, wires):
  qml.Hadamard(wires=wires[0])
  qml.RY(params[0], wires=wires[0])
  qml.CNOT(wires=wires)
  qml.SX(wires=wires[1])

hooks = {
  'SX': [
    lambda qc, gate: qc.p(-pi / 4, gate[1][0]),
    lambda qc, gate: qc.rx(pi / 2, gate[1][0]),
  ]
