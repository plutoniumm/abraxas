Abraxas is itself zero-dependency, but you will need to install the dependencies for the specific tasks you want to run. For example, if you want to use the `qiskit` with abraxas you will need qiskit too!

```sh
pip install abrax
```

## Caveats
We usually intend to keep things simple and easy to use, and therefore only simple gates and functions will be supported. If you need to use a more complex gate, you will need to decompose it first OR do the circuit conversion manually
