## Convert toPrime String
The Prime String is the intermediate representation of the quantum circuit. So before doing anything cross language, you need to convert the circuit to prime string.

> Make sure to decompose it since only the base gates are supported!

### Qiskit
Let's say we have a standard circuit `EfficientSU2` from Qiskit. We can convert it to prime string using `toPrime` function.

<Aside type="tip">
Make sure to run `.decompose` to make sure that the circuit is in basic gates.

```py
qc = qc.decompose()
```
</Aside>


```python
from qiskit.circuit.library import EfficientSU2
from abrax import toPrime

qc = EfficientSU2(3, reps=1).decompose()
string = toPrime(qc)

# IS THE SAME AS
# -0 ry(θ[0]) rz(θ[3]) cx(1)    ry(θ[6])
# -1 ry(θ[1]) rz(θ[4]) cx(2)    ry(θ[7])
# -2 ry(θ[2]) rz(θ[5]) ry(θ[8]) rz(θ[11])
```

### PennyLane
<Aside type="caution" title="Watch out!">
  Unfortunatelly, PennyLane does not let us inspect a circuit without parameters, therefore pennylane cannot be used fully for variational circuits. Only static circuits can be converted to prime string
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
Make sure to run `compile()` to make sure that the circuit is in basic gates.

```py
qfunc = qml.compile(qfunc)
```
</Aside>

```python
import pennylane as qml
dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=2)

@qml.qnode(dev)
def circuit(weights, f=None):
    qml.QAOAEmbedding(features=f, weights=weights, wires=range(2))
    return qml.expval(qml.PauliZ(0))

features = [1., 2.]
layer1 = [0.1, -0.3, 1.5]
layer2 = [3.1, 0.2, -2.8]
weights = [layer1, layer2]

print(circuit(weights, f=features))
```
